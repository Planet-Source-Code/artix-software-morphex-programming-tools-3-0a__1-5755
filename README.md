## Morphex Programming Tools 3\.0a


</div>

### Description

This program is a great example of how to code complicated functions in Microsoft Windows 95/98. With Morphex, you can: remove desktop icons, center forms, place forms OnTop, open Internet URLs, open/close the CD-Rom tray, disable the Key Buttons(Ctrl+Alt+Delete, Alt+Tab, and Windows Key), remove the start button, remove the taskbar, remove the taskbar icons, remove the taskbar clock, and remove the taskbar programs. This is a great program for cut-and-paste coding because all of the source code to the function is displayed while the function is in use. Everything is organized into a nice looking GUI with available clean-up option that resets your computer to its original state before the program started. This is the newest version of Morphex as of 1-28-2000. Check the site for more versions by going to search and using the keyword 'Morphex'.
