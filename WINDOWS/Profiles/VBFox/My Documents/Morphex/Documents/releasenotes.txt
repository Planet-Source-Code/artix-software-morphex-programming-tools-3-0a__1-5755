Morphex Programming Tools Version 3.0 Release Notes

Written By: John Hall - Developer and President of Artix Software

NOTE:This document is best viewed maximized with word-wrap on.

Noticed Items:
In Morphex, in order to get the desktop icons to dissapear upon the command button, you must be viewing the desktop. Otherwise the icons will remain on the desktop and you may not be able to get the function to work again unless you restart the program. Also, the URL may not work if you have not selected a default web browser or if you have and have not ever used it. These should be all the bugs in this program, but if you find more, kindly drop an email to Artix Software by emailing the developer giving the following information in this format:
